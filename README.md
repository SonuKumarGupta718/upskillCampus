## Project Description
This project focuses on the automated detection of crops and weeds from agricultural images using Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques. The objective is to help farmers identify weeds accurately and reduce excessive pesticide usage, thereby improving crop productivity and promoting sustainable farming practices.

The system uses the **YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm to detect and classify crops and weeds in real time from image data.

## Problem Statement
Weeds compete with crops for nutrients, water, and land, which leads to reduced agricultural yield. Manual weed detection is time-consuming, and excessive use of pesticides can be harmful. This project aims to develop an automated and intelligent solution for accurate crop and weed detection.
